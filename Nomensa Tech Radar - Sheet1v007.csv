Databases / Redis,Data,Evaluate,TRUE,new,"<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Redis, which stands for Remote Dictionary Server, is a open source, fast, in-memory database. Its most common use is for caching data. It stores strings, lists, hashes, bitmaps, geospatial data - and other structures. It can be used in clusters to add more resilience. Regarding data types and resiliency, it is more capable than memcache.</p>
<h3>Comments</h3>
<p>Most common use case at Nomensa would be for Drupal/LGD sites, although we don't currently use it on any of our existing sites. At a higher level, our use of Microsoft FrontDoor provides higher level caching which aids performance tremendously, but there is scope to add Redis or Memcache to the mix, particularly to improve performance further for authenticated users.</p>"

Databases / Memcache,Data,Assess,TRUE,new,"<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Memcache is an open source, fast, in-memory database, similar to Redis. It's faster than Redis but is primarily used for key:value storing of data, so the data structures are far simpler and limited. It also doesn't have Redis' ability to store data to disk for more persistence, nor does it have the clustering options Redis has.</p>
