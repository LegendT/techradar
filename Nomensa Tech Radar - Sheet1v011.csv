Regarding data types and resiliency, it is more capable than memcache.</p>
<h3>Comments</h3>
<p>Most common use case at Nomensa would be for Drupal/LGD sites, although we don't currently use it on any of our existing sites. At a higher level, our use of Microsoft FrontDoor provides higher level caching which aids performance tremendously, but there is scope to add Redis or Memcache to the mix, particularly to improve performance further for authenticated users.</p>"

javaScript / Node JS,Languages and Frameworks,Use,TRUE,new,"<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Node JS is a runtime for javaScript applications. Historically you would only be able to run javaScript in a browser to perform basic data fetching and/or DOM manipulation whereas today entire services can be built in javaScript.</p>
<p>From CMS' through to simple microservices, you can build almost anything in javaScript anywhere meaning teams can be more adaptive and flexible, essentially making your frontend devs fullstack devs.</p>
<p>Steep learning curve if trying to build something reaqlly complex like a CMS. Would recommend developers looked at either Express or Koa.</p>

<p>Node is a place where you can run most javaScript with a few exceptions (specifically around clientside - though there are workarounds in specific circumstances in the frontend frameworks.)</p>

javaScript / Typescript,Languages and Frameworks,Use,TRUE,new,"<h3>Description</h3>
<p>javaScript, whilst allowing developers to use multiple data types in their functionality, falls short when it comes to type checking. TypeScript fills this gap by enabling developers to add ""data security"" to their code. For example, a function might have accepted a parameter type of object which could've meant any object. But now you can create a schematic type for type for that same object and the code will fail if the keys/value don't match as specified in the type.</p>

<p>TypeScript acts as both a safety measure in javaScript and as documentation for code.</p>

Testing / BDD,Methods and Techniques,Use,TRUE,new,"<h3>Description</h3>
<p>An agile software development methodology that aims to enhance collaboration and communication among developers, testers, and business stakeholders.</p>

<p>It was introduced by Dan North in 2003. BDD focuses on defining the behavior of a system through examples and scenarios written in a human-readable format. Key features of BDD include the use of a ubiquitous language shared by all stakeholders, the creation of executable specifications called ""feature files,"" and the implementation of test automation to validate the desired behavior.
</p>

<p>BDD encourages a shift from traditional test-centric approaches to a more business-centric perspective, fostering a better understanding of system requirements. BDD frameworks such as Cucumber (for various programming languages) and SpecFlow (for .NET) provide tools for implementing BDD practices.
